Domestic violence remains one of the most prevalent yet underreported crimes in India. Women, especially those from rural and underprivileged backgrounds, face immense barriers in accessing justice. These include social stigma, lack of awareness about legal rights, fear of retaliation, and limited access to support services. Despite the existence of laws and helplines, the process of reporting abuse remains intimidating and inaccessible to many.
In response to this critical issue, we developed “NIRBHIK”, a secure and user-friendly digital platform designed to assist individuals—primarily women—in reporting domestic violence safely, discreetly, and with dignity. The term "NIRBHIK" translates to “fearless,” symbolizing the courage and strength of survivors who take the brave step to seek help. Our mission is to ensure that no woman feels alone, unheard, or helpless in the face of abuse.
The NIRBHIK platform is designed to be accessible, intuitive, and user-centric, particularly for individuals from rural or underprivileged backgrounds who may not have advanced digital literacy. A clean and minimalistic user interface (UI) is essential to reduce friction and guide users toward their goal—reporting domestic violence—without overwhelming them.
The NIRBHIK platform is built using a client-server architecture, where responsibilities are distributed between the client (frontend) and the server (backend). This architectural choice ensures scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.
